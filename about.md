I am a developer and photographer, founder of [Priime](https://priime.com) and currently working as the VP of Product for [Sunshine Health Studios Inc](https://itrackbites.com).

I love to merge my passion for visual art and computer science together to create new products that make something people love, better. On this site, you will see a combination of my photography portfolio, projects I'm working on in the tech world, and ramblings about what I have learned.

I've always said

> Community is as important as product. Can't have one without the other. They are symbiotic. Every company needs to focus on and love both.
