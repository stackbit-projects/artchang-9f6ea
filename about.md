I am a developer and photographer, CEO/founder of [Priime](https://priime.com) (backed by Y Combinator / Sherpalo / Initialized Captail / +) and currently working as the VP of Product for [Sunshine Health Studios Inc](https://itrackbites.com).

I also work as a commercial photographer and producer, working with various brands and clients in auto, fashion, fitness, and technology.

I love to merge my passion for visual art and computer science together to create new products that make something people love, better.

I've always said

> Community is as important as product. Can't have one without the other. They are symbiotic. Every company needs to focus on and love both.
